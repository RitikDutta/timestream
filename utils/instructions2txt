write timestamps in english

1. **Start with 0:00**: Begin the first timestamp at 0:00 to indicate the start of the video.

2. **Short Titles**: Keep each timestamp title concise, ideally no more than 5 words. Ensure titles are clear and descriptive.

3. **Focus on Key Points**: Identify and create timestamps only for significant points and major transitions within the video. Avoid adding timestamps for minor details or filler content.

4. **Consistent Format**: Use a consistent format for all timestamps. The structure should be:

   ```
   [Time] - [Title]
   ```

   Example: 
   ```
   0:00 - Introduction
   1:30 - Key Concept 1
   3:45 - Example Demonstration
   ```

5. **Logical Segmentation**: Segment the video logically, ensuring each timestamp represents a distinct section or topic.

6. **Clarity and Relevance**: Ensure each title is relevant to the content at that point in the video and provides viewers with a clear idea of what to expect.

7. **Avoid Redundancy**: Do not repeat similar timestamps. Each timestamp should introduce new information or a new segment.

8. **Limit the Number of Timestamps**: Aim to create only the most essential timestamps, keeping the total number manageable (e.g., 5-10 timestamps for a 10-15 minute video).

9. **Verify Accuracy**: Double-check the timestamps against the video content to ensure they match correctly with the points being discussed.

10. **Refine Timing**: After generating the initial timestamps, manually verify and adjust them to ensure they align perfectly with the actual topics. Pay attention to the exact start of each section or topic.
